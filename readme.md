# Steam Actionset Display #

In the latest Steam update Valve has managed to completely remove notifications
when changing controller actionsets.

For certain speedruns we generally use a toggle to switch between the sets
and rely on the prompt to know we have the correct controls. This tool attempts
to provide alternatives to the now non-working steam notifications.

Hopefully it will be fixed but this is not the first time these have been broken.

## How to use ##

In this testing phase there isn't an .exe so you'll need to have python 3.11 
installed. Get that from python.org or directly here: 
[python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe)

There are two powershell scripts to help setup python for the application
and launch the application.
